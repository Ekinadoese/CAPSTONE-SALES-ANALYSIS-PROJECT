## DATA SOURCES

The data for this project was provided by the admin of the Ladies in Tech Initiative as part of a prerequisite project for advancing my analytical journey and fulfilling certification requirements.

## TOOLS USED

This project leverages a range of powerful tools to efficiently collect, clean, analyze, and visualize sales data:

- **Microsoft Excel**: Used for initial data exploration, cleaning, and transformation, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
- **SQL**: Employed for querying and managing data from relational databases, facilitating data extraction and transformation.
- **Power BI**: Utilized to build interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing insights through dynamic reports.

These tools collectively enabled seamless data management and visualization, ensuring accurate reporting and informed decision-making.

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

The data cleaning process for the sales analysis project involved several key steps to ensure the dataset was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis:

- Data Collection: The initial dataset was received from the Ladies in Tech Initiative, ensuring all relevant sales information was included.
- Data Inspection: A thorough review of the dataset was conducted to identify any discrepancies, missing values, or outliers that could affect the analysis.
- Standardization: Data formats were standardized, including date formats and categorical values, to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- Data Validation: Final checks were performed to confirm the accuracy of data entries and to ensure that all values fell within expected ranges.
- Data Loading: Data was loaded into analytics tools for analysis

By following these steps, the dataset was cleaned and optimized for accurate analysis, leading to reliable insights and actionable recommendations.

Some of the data cleaning and preparation process include:

### Excel ###

- Performing an initial exploration of the sales data, using pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month
- Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region, and product by quantity sold
- Creating a dashboard to visualize results
  
### SQL ###

- Loading the dataset into SQL Server environment to write and validate queries.
- Writing queries to extract key insights based on the following questions. 
     *Retrieve the total sales for each product category.*
     *Find the number of sales transactions in each region.*
     *Find the highest-selling product by total sales value.*
     *Calculate total revenue per product.*
     *Calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.*
     *Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.*
     *Calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.*
     *Identify products with no sales in the last quarter.*
  
  ### Power BI ###
  
- Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL

**FINDINGS FROM TOTAL SALES BY PRODUCT**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b811b8-cc16-4a7e-8ab0-4dde5a0224aa)

From the above indicators drawn from the data set, the below can be deduced

**Top-Selling Product**:

Shoes are the highest-selling product, generating a total of 3,087,500. This indicates strong demand, suggesting potential for further promotion or expansion in this category.
Lowest-Selling Product:

**Least-Selling Product**:

Socks have the lowest total sales at 912,500. This may indicate a need for reevaluation of marketing strategies or product placement, as it shows less consumer interest.
Sales Distribution:

**Sales Distribution**:

The sales distribution among the products indicates a diverse product range, with Gloves and Shirt also performing well at 1,500,000 and 2,450,000, respectively.
The cumulative sales from the top three products (Shoes, Shirt, Gloves) contribute significantly to the overall total, suggesting these categories should receive focused marketing efforts.

**Overall Performance**:

The grand total of 10,587,500 reflects healthy overall sales, indicating a positive market response and potential for growth in future quarters.
Potential Areas for Improvement:

**Inference**

The total sales of Socks being significantly lower compared to other products suggests that either the product does not meet customer needs, or it requires improved marketing strategies to enhance visibility.


**FINDINGS FROM TOTAL REVENUE BY REGION**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cce404d-b318-4469-b86f-a1ade3dc7ec8)

Based on the sales data by region as represented by the pie chart, here are the key findings:

**Top-Performing Region**:

The South region is the highest-performing, generating total sales of 4,675,000. This indicates strong market demand and customer engagement in this area, suggesting it could be a focus for further investment or targeted marketing strategies.

**Lowest-Performing Region**:

The West region has the lowest total sales at 1,512,500. This could signify lower consumer interest or market penetration challenges in this region, indicating a need for strategic improvements in marketing and distribution efforts.

**Sales Distribution**:

The overall sales distribution shows that the South and East regions together contribute a significant portion of total sales. Combined, these two regions account for 6,172,500, which is about 58% of the grand total. This indicates that resources and marketing efforts should prioritize these areas to maximize revenue.

**Overall Performance**:

The grand total of 10,587,500 reflects a healthy overall performance across all regions, indicating a positive response to the products offered. However, it highlights discrepancies in regional performance, suggesting a need for tailored strategies.
Opportunities for Growth:

**Inference**
The North region, with total sales of 1,950,000, presents a moderate performance but still has potential for growth. Engaging local markets more effectively through targeted promotions could yield better results.


**FINDINGS FROM MONTHLY TOTAL SALES**

From the line chart depicting total sales over a period from January 2023 to August 2024, here are the key inferences:

**Fluctuating Sales Patterns**:

The total sales exhibit significant fluctuations over the observed period, indicating seasonal trends or varying market conditions that affect consumer behavior.

**Peak Sales**:

Notably, there were peaks in sales in February 2023 and December 2023, reaching approximately 1,600,000. These peaks suggest that these months are potentially high-demand periods, possibly linked to seasonal buying trends or promotional events.

**Low Sales Periods**:

The lowest sales were recorded in April 2024, where total sales dipped dramatically. This drop may indicate a slow sales period, which could be due to various factors, such as post-holiday lulls or insufficient marketing efforts.

**Gradual Recovery**:

After the sharp decline in April 2024, total sales show a gradual recovery trend into mid-2024, indicating a potential rebound in consumer interest or improved sales strategies.

**Overall Performance**:

The overall sales trend reflects a considerable variation, suggesting that while there are times of high performance, there are also critical periods requiring strategic interventions to maintain sales momentum.
