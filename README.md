**FINDINGS FROM TOTAL SALES BY PRODUCT**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ce9cc4-f16e-4ee7-a4f0-405d55f453c3)

From the above indicators drawn from the data set, the below can be deduced

**Top-Selling Product**:

Shoes are the highest-selling product, generating a total of  613,380.00. This indicates strong demand, suggesting potential for further promotion or expansion in this category.

**Least-Selling Product**:

Socks have the lowest total sales at  180,785.00. This may indicate a need for reevaluation of marketing strategies or product placement, as it shows less consumer interest.

**Sales Distribution**:

The sales distribution among the products indicates a diverse product range, with Hat and Shirt also performing well at   316,195.00 
 and  485,600.00, respectively.
The cumulative sales from the top three products (Shoes, Shirt, Hat) contribute significantly to the overall total, suggesting these categories should receive focused marketing efforts.

**Overall Performance**:

The grand total of  2,101,090.00 reflects healthy overall sales, indicating a positive market response and potential for growth in future quarters.


**Potential Areas for Improvement:**

The total sales of Socks being significantly lower compared to other products suggests that either the product does not meet customer needs, or it requires improved marketing strategies to enhance visibility.


**FINDINGS FROM TOTAL REVENUE BY REGION**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30c22754-5bd5-4f1f-a146-7e2bc3f85a90)

Based on the sales data by region as represented by the pie chart, here are the key findings:

**Top-Performing Region**:

The South region is the highest-performing, generating total sales of  927,820.00. This indicates strong market demand and customer engagement in this area, suggesting it could be a focus for further investment or targeted marketing strategies.

**Lowest-Performing Region**:

The West region has the lowest total sales at  300,345.00. This could signify lower consumer interest or market penetration challenges in this region, indicating a need for strategic improvements in marketing and distribution efforts.

**Sales Distribution**:

The overall sales distribution shows that the South and East regions together contribute a significant portion of total sales. Combined, these two regions account for  1,413,745.00, which is about 67% of the grand total. This indicates that resources and marketing efforts should prioritize these areas to maximize revenue.

**Overall Performance**:

The grand total of  2,101,090.00 reflects a healthy overall performance across all regions, indicating a positive response to the products offered. However, it highlights discrepancies in regional performance, suggesting a need for tailored strategies.
Opportunities for Growth:

**Inference**
The North region, with total sales of  387,000.00, presents a moderate performance but still has potential for growth. Engaging local markets more effectively through targeted promotions could yield better results.


**FINDINGS FROM MONTHLY TOTAL SALES**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3cd70bd-5013-45f6-88ea-4cade1897203)

From the line chart depicting total sales over a period from January 2023 to August 2024, here are the key inferences:

**Fluctuating Sales Patterns**:

The total sales exhibit significant fluctuations over the observed period, indicating seasonal trends or varying market conditions that affect consumer behavior.

**Peak Sales**:

Notably, there were peaks in sales in February 2023 July 2023 and February 2024, reaching approximately  784,000.00. These peaks suggest that these months are potentially high-demand periods, possibly linked to seasonal buying trends or promotional events.

**Low Sales Periods**:

The lowest sales were recorded in April 2023, where total sales dipped dramatically. This drop may indicate a slow sales period, which could be due to various factors, such as post-holiday lulls or insufficient marketing efforts.

**Gradual Recovery**:

After the sharp decline in April 2023, total sales show a gradual recovery trend into the peak period in July 2023, indicating a potential rebound in consumer interest, onset of season, or improved sales strategies.

**Overall Performance**:

The overall sales trend reflects a considerable variation, suggesting that while there are times of high performance, there are also critical periods requiring strategic interventions to maintain sales momentum.

## SUMMARY OF SQL QUERIES 

[SQL TABLE.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17446950/SQL.TABLE.xlsx)

## FINDINGS FROM THE SQL QUERIES OUTPUT

**Sales Performance by Product**:

- Shoes generate the highest revenue (613,380), indicating they are the best-selling product by value.
- Shirts also perform well with 485,600 in revenue, suggesting strong demand.
- Socks generate the lowest revenue (180,785), possibly indicating a lower selling price or fewer transactions.

**Sales Transactions by Region**:

- South leads in total transactions (24,298) and accounts for 44% of total sales by value, making it the most profitable region.
- West shows the lowest number of transactions (11,400) and 14% of sales, suggesting lower engagement or demand.

**Seasonality in Sales**:

- Monthly sales data suggests a peak in February (298,800), potentially due to seasonal factors or promotions.
- April (39,440) and July (37,200) show significant drops, suggesting low-demand periods that may need targeted campaigns to boost sales.

**Inventory or Stock Efficiency**:

- All products have recorded sales in the last quarter, as indicated by the absence of any product with zero sales. This suggests efficient stock management without idle inventory.


## CONCLUSION

The following conclusions can be drawn from the analysis done 

- The sales analysis indicates that while some products are performing exceptionally well, there is room for growth in specific categories. Strategic marketing efforts could enhance sales performance across the product range, especially focusing on lower-performing products. 

- The analysis also indicates strong sales performance in the South region, with notable opportunities for improvement in the West. Regional marketing strategies should be adjusted to enhance visibility and consumer interest, especially in underperforming areas, to capitalize on overall sales potential.

- It also highlights the importance of understanding sales dynamics over time, particularly in identifying peak periods for marketing and sales efforts. The observed fluctuations suggest that seasonal strategies could be beneficial for optimizing sales throughout the year. Additionally, addressing the causes of low sales in specific months could enhance overall revenue performance.

- The business is performing well overall, with a few standout products and a key regional market driving growth. However, opportunities exist to optimize underperforming products, address regional imbalances, and better manage seasonal fluctuations. The company should leverage its top customers, strengthen marketing efforts in weaker regions, and maintain operational efficiency to sustain growth and profitability
